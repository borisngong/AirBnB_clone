# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

# Project Description:

# The goal of this project is to provide a command-line interface (CLI) for

# managing different parts of property rental listings.

# It is a stripped-down clone of the AirBnB platform. Creating, reading,

# updating, and deleting (CRUD) activities for various property listing kinds,

# such as states, cities, places, users, and more, are among the primary

# characteristics.

# description of the command interpreter:

# -A command-line interface (CLI) tool called the command interpreter enables

# users to communicate with the Airbnb clone application.

# -It offers a range of commands to carry out several tasks, including handling

# reservations, adding users, and managing lodging.

# -A Python script serves as the command interpreter, offering a CLI for

# utilizing the AirBnB clone feature.

# -It enables users to carry out CRUD operations—creating new listings,

# obtaining existing listings, editing listing information, and removing

# listings—on the different entities inside the system.

# -Multiple commands are supported via the command interpreter, which also

# gives the user feedback depending on what they have done.

# How to start

# To launch the command interpreter, take the following actions:

# Make a local copy of the repository on your computer:

# airbnb_clone.git on github.com/your_username.

# Go into the project directory:

# cd airbnb_clone

# Make sure Python is installed on your computer. Python 3.6 and later

# versions are compatible with this project.

# Open the Python3 console.py command interpreter script and run it.

# How to Use

# You can use commands to communicate with the AirBnB clone capability

# once the command interpreter has started.

# The commands generally take the following form:

# (command) (class) (action) (parameters)

# -The variable (command) represent the supported commands (e.g., create, show,

# update, destroy, all)

# -The variable class or entity name (e.g., State, City, User)

# -The action you want to perform (e.g., create, show, update, destroy, all),

# -Any additional parameters (e.g., object ID, attribute values) that are

# needed for the action.

# Examples:

# These are a few instances of how to use the command interpreter:

# \*create(forming) a new sate

# (hbnb) create State name="Yaounde"

# (hbnb)

# \*Deleting(Eliniating) a user

# (Hbnb) destroy User 1234-5678
